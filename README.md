## Experience in Software Development
With over 15 years of experience in the field of software development, I started my career working with Visual Basic 6 and expanded my knowledge over time to include .NET development.

### Sipolatti
During my time at Sipolatti, I had the opportunity to lead development projects using Visual Basic .NET and C#. Among these projects, I highlight the following:

- Creation of a goods conference and inventory system for Windows CE, later rewritten for the Android platform.
- Development of an interface and integration robots for SAP, connecting the legacy system to this platform.
- Creation of various applications in different areas of the company, including logistics, store dispatch, credit, marketing, and administrative headquarters.

### Skill Set
Over the years, I expanded my skill set beyond .NET and Visual Basic. Currently, I work with various other programming languages, including:

- C#
- Python
- Kotlin

### Focus on Artificial Intelligence
One of the areas I have been recently dedicated to is Artificial Intelligence (AI). I am working on the creation of software that utilizes AI to identify employees and customers, performing accurate counting and providing reliable data. I believe that the application of AI can bring a tremendous positive impact by increasing process efficiency and assisting in strategic decision-making.
